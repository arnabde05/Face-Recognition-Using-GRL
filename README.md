## Introduction

In the field of face recognition, Graph Representation Learning has shown promising results. This repository explores three different methods for face recognition using graphs: Node2Vec, DeepWalk, and GraRep. Each method has its unique approach to learning representations from graph data.

## Methods

### Node2Vec

Node2Vec is a graph embedding technique that learns continuous representations for nodes in a graph. In the context of face recognition, Node2Vec can be used to capture meaningful features from face graphs.

### DeepWalk

DeepWalk is another graph embedding method that leverages random walks to generate embeddings for nodes. DeepWalk can be applied to face graphs to create feature representations for face recognition tasks.

### GraRep

GraRep stands for Graph Representation Learning via Graph Partitioning. It is a method that considers higher-order proximity information in graphs, which can be beneficial for capturing complex relationships in face data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Download the necessary datasets or prepare your own face graph data.
4. Choose the method (Node2Vec, DeepWalk, or GraRep) you want to use and navigate to the respective directory for detailed instructions.

## Usage

Provide clear instructions on how to use your code and apply the three different methods for face recognition. Include examples, command-line options, and any relevant configuration details.
